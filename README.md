## Made in Bharat

Made in Bharat is an initiative to have a curated list of swadeshi (Indian made) products across all categories at one place. This could be a helpful catalogue for anyone to search for Indian made products and could give a boost to the _Swadeshi Movement_ going on in India. You can find the website [here](https://madeinbharat.github.io/).

### Contribution Guidelines

Below mentioned guidelines have been adopted from [awesome list contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md).

#### Adding to an existing category
Please ensure that your pull request adheres to the following guidelines :
- Search if the brand is already existing in the list under that category, as yours entry may be a duplicate.
- Make sure that the brand is a legitimate Indian brand. That implies it has enough sources that could be found on the internet, has a website and a logo.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com/) (AP style).
- Add logo file of the brand to the logo folder.
- Use the following format: ```[Brand Name](link) <img src='logo/brand-name.png' height='20px'/>```
- Add the above entry in alphabetical order of the brand name.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- If the brand does not have logo or website but you still think it should make to this list then create an issue [here](https://github.com/madeinbharat/madeinbharat.github.io/issues/new) and this could be discussed.

#### Creating a new category
If you think that there is some new category which should be added to this list then start a [discussion here](https://github.com/madeinbharat/madeinbharat.github.io/issues/new) and we would be happy to include it to the list if it is not too off the topic.
